## About Entalpi
After years of coaching top athletes to world class results and world records, we launched an ambition to make our state of the art training method and sports technology available for athletes all over the world. With [Entalpi](https://entalpi.com) our ambition is to break both personal and world records and to change the way athletes train. Welcome to a new era where training, technology and big data is combined in a new and unique way to push human limits to new heights!

## Description of the dataset
This repository contains data from Gustav's and Kristian's run during the 2022 Ironman world championships.
The data was recorded on their sport watches. Not all the data that was collected is published, for privacy and competive reasons.
The data that is published is:
- speed [m/s]
- cadence [/min]
- stride length [m]
- heartrate [bpm]
- elevation [m]
- gps location (latitude and longitude) [Â°]
- core temperature [Â°C] (only for Kristian)
- skin temperature [Â°C] (only for Kristian)

The data from both athletes is stored in 2 separate .csv files ([Gustav](./gustav_iden_copyright_entalpi_as.csv), [Kristian](./kristian_blummenfelt_copyright_entalpi_as.csv)) that are identical in format (order of columns might differ):
```csv
